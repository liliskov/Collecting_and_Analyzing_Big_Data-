Trump ramps up drama as he picks Supreme Court judge,"Ben Hoyle, Los Angeles",Friday June 11 2021," President Trump kicked off a fierce battle for control of the Supreme Court last night when he nominated a staunch conservative for the vacancy that Barack Obama had been prevented by Republicans from filling. With characteristic showmanship the former Apprentice host unveiled Neil Gorsuch as his chosen nominee on prime time television, having first ramped up the suspense by summoning both leading candidates for the lifetime appointment to the capital. Moments after he revealed Judge Gorsuch, 49, as his pick, Mr Trump stretched his arms out before a White House audience that included senior political figures, members of the president’s family and the widow of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose death created the vacancy. “So, was that a surprise? Was it?” Mr Trump demanded. © Times Newspapers Limited 2021. Registered in England No. 894646.

Opponents ousted and mocked as Trump hits back,"Rhys Blakely, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," A defiant President Trump attacked political opponents for obstructing his efforts to appoint a cabinet yesterday, as the row over his new immigration restrictions raged on. Hundreds of US diplomats were believed to have signed an official state department memo condemning the travel ban. “A policy which closes our doors to over 200 million legitimate travellers . . . will not achieve its aim of making our country safer,” it read. The number of signatories was not immediately made available but more than 800 state department staff had said they would back a draft of the document, according to an official.

"We had bigger crowds than Obama, insists Trump team","Rhys Blakely, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," The Trump White House has signalled a combative new relationship with the press by describing as “shameful” reports that the inauguration on Friday attracted smaller crowds than Barack Obama did in 2009. The row over the size of the crowd dominated an antagonistic first briefing by Sean Spicer, the new White House press secretary. It was regarded as a further sign that President Trump and his team intend to stick with the pugilistic campaign style that propelled him to victory. “These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,” Mr Spicer said. “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.” After that assessment was widely disputed, Kellyanne Conway, a © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

BMW shares go into reverse after Trump tax threat,"David Charter, Berlin | Bruno Waterfield, Brussels",Friday June 11 2021," Trump January 17 2017, 12:01am, The Times German politicians and industry leaders hit back at Donald Trump yesterday after his threat of border taxes on BMW sent shares diving. Mr Trump singled out the German company in his wide-ranging interview in The Times yesterday. He warned that it was in line for US import duties of 35 per cent on vehicles made in a factory that BMW is building in Mexico. The president-elect made similar threats to US carmakers earlier this month. He claimed that this was behind Ford switching a planned production plant from Mexico to the US. Mr Trump complained that more German cars could be seen on the streets of New York than US cars on German streets.

Trump legacy is pile of unwanted history,"David Charter, Berlin",Friday June 11 2021," A chunk of Trump real estate is being offered for sale in Germany, but potential buyers will need to enjoy the media spotlight. Donald Trump’s grandfather lived at Number 20 Freinsheimer Strasse in the village of Kallstadt before emigrating to the US and setting in train a series of improbable events leading to the White House. Friedrich Trump first left the sleepy wine-making Rhineland community in 1885 to make his fortune in the US, returning 15 years later to marry Elizabeth Christ, who lived in the house opposite. They fled Germany for good in 1905 so that Mr Trump could escape conscription into the army. His grandson would later avoid the draft for the Vietnam War.

Donald Trump turns fire on Anthony Fauci in return to campaign trail,"Ben Hoyle, Los Angeles",Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump has returned to the campaign trail with an attack on Dr Anthony Fauci, a demand for $10 trillion in coronavirus “reparations” from China and a long list of familiar grievances. In his first political appearance outside his home state of Florida since being prised from the White House in January, the former president reiterated his groundless allegation that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him in what he called “the crime of the century”. Polls indicate that most Republicans believe the claim even though administration officials attested at the time that it had been “the most secure in American history” and dozens of judges since then have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud.

Netanyahu decries ‘biggest fraud in history of democracy’ during Trumpian outburst,"Anshel Pfeffer, Jerusalem",Friday June 11 2021," In a Trumpian outburst at a meeting of his Likud party members in Jerusalem this afternoon, the Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu called the government about to be formed “the biggest election fraud in the history of the state, and I think in the history of democracies.” Netanyahu was referring to the coalition expected to be sworn in within a week, lead by his former aide turned right-wing party leader Naftali Bennett. The incoming government is relying on a wafer-thin majority of members from right-wing, centrist, left-wing and Arab parties and Netanyahu promised that Likud would “forcefully oppose this dangerous government of fraud and surrender and if it is formed, we will topple it very soon”.

Robert O’Brien, the national security adviser, did. “This will be the biggest national security threat you will face in your presidency,” he warned. “Is this going to be as bad or worse than Sars in 2003?” Trump asked. The briefer responded that it wasn’t clear yet. Matthew Pottinger, deputy national security adviser, who was sitting on a couch, jumped to his feet.

His account was suspended after the riots. “We love you. You’re very special,” Trump, 74, said to the rioters in his first post. In a second, he called them “great patriots” and told them to “remember this day forever”. It is still possible to read old messages but the former president is prevented from publishing anything new. He is also banned from Twitter.

She tweeted almost nine times more often than the ranting US president, and now she’s had to leave the site after she tweeted: “Never never never trust a Tory.” The account, which was adorned with a pro-Remain banner, has been deactivated with church leaders saying they “do not support intemperate claims or poorly informed commentary”.

It marketed itself as a “beacon of freedom” and “a place to speak freely and safely”. Trump, 74, used it to rile up his supporters, attack his opponents, including the Republican senator Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney — a former senior House Republican who was ousted from her leadership position last month — and repeat his baseless assertions that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against him.

Rather than halting the Willow project the justice department argued that Trump’s approval was reasonable and lawful.

Liz Cheney vows to lead the Republican anti-Trump resistance,"David Charter, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," Liz Cheney vowed to lead the internal Republican battle to stop Donald Trump returning to the White House after colleagues in the House of Representatives ousted her from the party leadership yesterday.

She turned on Trump over his role in stoking the attack on the US Capitol on January 6 but found herself increasingly out of step with her party as it closed ranks.

Trump supporters band together to push Liz Cheney out of the Republican picture,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," It is a mantra of American politics that divided parties lose elections. Having lost both the White House and the Senate to a Democratic Party that unified effectively around Joe Biden last November, the Republicans face a challenge to come together for the next electoral test of the midterms in 2022. Their strategy is becoming clearer. Despite voters’ rejection of Donald Trump, and the shock felt by many leading Republicans at the attack on the US Capitol that was fuelled by his refusal to accept defeat, they have been regrouping around him. He led them to victory in 2016 and forged a more working-class voter base that continues to underpin his grip on the party.

Bodyguards ‘got a little too close to two Trump women’,"Alistair Dawber, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," Two members of Donald Trump’s family got “inappropriately — and perhaps dangerously — close” to members of the secret service who were assigned to protect them, a new book has alleged. Vanessa Trump, the former wife of Donald Jr, the former president’s son, “started dating one of the agents who had been assigned to her family”, according to Carol Leonnig, a Washington Post journalist, in Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of the Secret Service. In 2017 Don Jr is reported to have asked that his family have their round-the-clock protection removed because they wanted more privacy. The couple divorced the following year.

Last Tuesday, four months after Trump was booted off Twitter, Facebook and YouTube following the deadly Capitol riot on January 6, a new “communications platform” was unveiled. The game had not been so much redefined as rewound to the Noughties. “From the Desk of Donald J Trump” is essentially a blog where users can do little more than share Trump’s posts on their own social media accounts and donate money to the Trump coffers.

Facebook’s ban on Trump is a threat to free speech,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," In 1988, after a succession of murderous IRA terrorist attacks, Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government imposed a controversial broadcasting ban on representatives of Sinn Fein. The restriction, ordered without legislation by the home secretary under existing broadcasting laws, forbade the BBC and others from transmitting the voices of members of the IRA’s political arm, along with other proscribed organisations. Though Mrs Thatcher had intended the measure to “deny terrorists the oxygen of publicity”, the language of the ban was narrowly drawn, forbidding the airing of the voices but not necessarily the words of those sanctioned. Incensed at what they saw as an infringement on both press freedom and wider freedom of speech, broadcasters, led by the BBC, quickly came up with a solution that infuriated the © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

The board said that Facebook was right to silence Trump after inflammatory postings on January 6 as his supporters rioted at the US Capitol. It added, however, that it was wrong to issue an indefinite suspension without stating clear criteria for an eventual return or exclusion.

Joe Biden nominates diverse judges in riposte to Trump years,"Charlie Mitchell, Ottawa",Friday June 11 2021," President Biden has selected his first group of “trailblazing” judicial nominees, including three black women, fulfilling a key campaign pledge to diversify America’s top courts. The slate of 11 prospective judges includes nine from ethnic minorities and nine women. If confirmed, Zahid Quraishi, an army veteran, will be the first Muslim federal judge in US history. Spaces on federal courts are hotly contested and politically charged. The nation’s 13 federal appeals courts have the last word on most legal appeals around the country. Reshaping America’s courts was a key concern for President Trump and an area of rare success for his administration.

US voting ‘reforms’ in the aftermath of Trump raise spectre of segregated past,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," The electoral map of Chicago looks absurd. It includes the fourth congressional district of Illinois which appears to have been drawn by someone drunk in charge of an Etch A Sketch toy. Some say it looks like a dog’s head, others see earmuffs. In Georgia last week, a row over voting reform erupted into accusations that the new measures were racist. These apparently unconnected matters are at the heart of one of the most bitter battles in American politics, which has led President Biden, 78, to compare them to the civil rights struggle.

Donald Trump fires salvo at Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx,"Charlie Mitchell, Ottawa",Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump attacked Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, his administration’s most senior coronavirus advisers, last night after the pair criticised his pandemic response in a documentary. The former president regularly made false claims about the virus and minimised its severity. After a first wave in the spring Trump, 74, who would later contract Covid-19 and be taken to hospital, pushed for cities to reopen, questioned the efficacy of masks and touted untested remedies. “Based on their interviews, I felt it was time to speak up about Dr Fauci and Dr Birx, two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover up for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations, which I fortunately almost always overturned,” Trump said yesterday, a day after the documentary was broadcast on CNN. © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Powell, 65, is facing a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, a US company that supplied voting machines, accusing her of peddling misinformation about its equipment in her weeks-long attempt to invalidate President Biden’s victory.

"Donald Trump lost $700m in office, report says","Charlie Mitchell, Ottawa",Friday June 11 2021," The presidency cost Donald Trump an estimated $700m in lost wealth, according to a new analysis of his fortune, with the coronavirus pandemic and Capitol siege slashing income and damaging his brand. Trump stepped away from his real estate and branding empire to serve as president, transferring control to his sons, Donald Jr and Eric. He nevertheless visited his properties dozens of times, requiring his security detail to spend thousands at his businesses and welcoming foreign leaders to his Florida resort of Mar-a-Lago. That did not stop him losing hundreds of millions of dollars while in office.

Hangers-on applaud Trump into Mar-a-Lago as he plots Republican revenge,"Ben Hoyle, Los Angeles",Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump will lay out his vision for the Republican Party this weekend in his first public appearance since leaving the White House last month. For weeks the former president has been hunkered down at his Florida private members club, basking in the acclaim of his admirers there, playing golf and receiving visits from conservative politicians eager to secure his support. Banned permanently from Twitter and facing investigations into his businesses, Trump was less present in American public life over the past month than at any time since he began his long-shot campaign for the presidency in 2015.

Donald Trump opened back channel to Kim Jong-un,"Philip Sherwell, Asia Correspondent",Friday June 11 2021," In late 2017 the spectre of nuclear war loomed over the world as Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and Donald Trump traded apocalyptic threats and searing invective, while Pyongyang conducted salvos of weapons tests. But a television documentary will reveal this week that, even as Trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on “Rocket Man”, the US president launched an audacious and previously unreported back-channel diplomatic initiative. Months before there was any public hint of a rapprochement and unknown even to close aides, Trump sent a message to Pyongyang that he would be willing to meet his adversary. That approach kindled an implausible “bromance” and culminated in two historic summits, as chronicled in Trump Takes on the World, to be broadcast on BBC2 © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Joe Biden considers easing Trump’s sanctions on Iran to bring nuclear deal back from the brink,"Josh Glancy, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," The Biden administration is considering offering Iran sanctions relief as America seeks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. President Biden fired the starting gun on re-entering the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), on Thursday with a statement declaring that America is willing to sit down for an “informal meeting” with the Iranians, which would be hosted by the EU and also attended by Britain, Russia and China. The Iranians have demanded relief from crippling Trump-era sanctions — which they claim have cost them more than $150 billion — as a price for returning to negotiations. There are indications that sanctions relief is on the way, though the Biden administration insists it wants a sit-down first. “Sanctions relief is definitely coming,” © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Former Trump ally Nikki Haley claims she should lead Republicans,"David Charter, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," Nikki Haley set out her vision for a post-Trump path to power for the Republicans as she made her pitch to become the party’s figurehead. Haley, 49, vowed to defend and advance Donald Trump’s “outstanding” policy achievements but made clear that she found his behaviour on January 6 when his supporters stormed the Capitol “indefensible”. The former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the UN in Trump’s administration is seen as a contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. She broke with Trump decisively in an interview last week, saying: “He let us down . . . we shouldn’t have followed him.” Yesterday she used an article in The Wall Street Journal to try to attract Republicans ready to move on from the former president. © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Trump, 74, repeated false claims that he won the election and boasted of soaring poll numbers as he phoned in to three conservative networks for his first post-presidency TV interviews. The former president’s approval ratings dropped to all-time lows after January 6, when his supporters stormed the US Capitol, but have recovered among Republicans since he went on trial in the Senate.

Donald Trump overshadows all Republicans who would succeed him in fresh opinion polls,Alistair Dawber,Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump launched a ferocious campaign to oust the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, as opinion polls showed him retaining a firm grip over the party faithful. Trump branded McConnell “a dour, sullen and unsmiling political hack” who would “never do what needs to be done, or what is right for our country”. It followed the senator’s criticism of Trump, 74, as “practically and morally responsible for inducing a mob to storm the Capitol”, even though he voted to acquit him in the impeachment trial.

However, Trump, 74, retains grassroots support, leaving figures who oppose him facing anger from their constituents and a battle for survival in primary contests.

Donald Trump’s acquittal this time is very different from his first one: many top Republicans voted and spoke against him; he is silent after being banished from social media; and he is no longer president. His grip on the party has been loosened by his own actions on January 6 and the impeachment trial that highlighted his dereliction of duty as he stoked up anger and did too little to call off the mob. Yet Senate Republicans baulked at their chance to have him convicted and disqualified from public office.

Some of those Republicans would have been in grave danger had the mob that invaded Capitol Hill got hold of them, including the former vice-president, Mike Pence.

Seven Republicans joined 50 Democrats to vote for conviction, making it the most bipartisan impeachment result in American history. But the votes did not come close to the 67 required. Afterwards, the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, rebuked Republicans for their loyalty to Trump. “This was about choosing country over Donald Trump, and 43 Republican members chose Trump,” he said. “They chose Trump.

"Sham trial is just cancel culture, claim Trump lawyers","David Charter, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump’s legal team dismissed his impeachment trial yesterday as “constitutional cancel culture”, a “sham” and a danger to free speech as they urged senators to acquit him of inciting insurrection. They argued that it was “preposterous and monstrous” to claim Trump wanted violence on January 6, given his record of promoting law and order. He had called for supporters to march “peacefully and patriotically” to the Capitol before a small group “hijacked the event” and stormed the building, they said. The “witch-hunt” against the former president was fuelled by “hatred, vitriol and political opportunism”, his lawyers argued.

He now faces six charges, two of them carrying a maximum 20 years in jail, for his role in the riot.

Siggi Olafsson interview — Trump’s medicine man rides the storm,The Sunday Times,Friday June 11 2021," More than two feet of snow fell outside Siggi Olafsson’s home in New Jersey last week, blocking in his Porsche and forcing the chief executive of FTSE 100 drug-maker Hikma to take a taxi to work. In normal times, this might have been an imposition. But Olafsson, who oversees 29 manufacturing plants in 11 countries, has spent 11 months battling to ensure hospitals across America are stocked with Hikma medicines to treat the coronavirus. His patients have included Donald Trump. A snowstorm is small beer. “Nothing can prepare you for a pandemic like this, both personally and as a pharmaceuticals manufacturer,” says Olafsson.

How Donald Trump’s impeachment trial in Senate will work,Josh Glancy,Friday June 11 2021," Opening arguments in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump will begin in the US Senate this week. He is the first president to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives and the first former president to face a Senate trial. Trump has been charged with “incitement of insurrection” over the violent invasion of Congress that took place on January 6. The four-page article of impeachment claims Trump “gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government”. These charges were voted on in the House of Representatives on January 13 and passed by 232-197, with 10 Republicans joining Democrats to support impeachment. Having passed the House, the articles are being brought to the Senate where a majority of two-thirds is © Times Newspapers Limited 2021. Registered in England No. 894646.

The song begins: “And now the end is near” — but is it? Trump fully expects to survive and thrive politically after his impeachment trial for inciting the violent storming of the US Capitol opens on Tuesday in the Senate. “He is going to be acquitted,” Jason Miller, Trump’s senior adviser, told me confidently last week. “There is no real scenario in which he is going to be convicted, so the pressure is completely off.” Far from raging in exile, Miller revealed, the former president “feels happier” than he did in the White House and is pleased no longer to be on © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Joe Biden says ‘erratic’ Donald Trump should not receive intelligence briefings,"David Charter, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," President Biden will ban his predecessor Donald Trump from receiving intelligence briefings like other past presidents because of his “erratic behavior”, he said last night. The president has the ultimate say over whether former administration officials, including past presidents, continue to receive top secret updates. The White House said earlier this week that the national security team was reviewing access for Trump amid fears that he could misuse sensitive information either by accident or on purpose. “I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings,” Biden said in an interview with CBS. “What value is giving him an intelligence briefing?

White House may deny Donald Trump access to intelligence briefings,"David Charter, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," President Biden is considering stopping Donald Trump from accessing intelligence briefings, a courtesy usually extended to former occupants of the Oval Office, in the wake of his conduct in office. Trump, 74, is facing a second impeachment trial next week after being accused of incitement of insurrection. He had a tense relationship with the national security agencies while in office, publicly siding with President Putin of Russia against them in 2018. When Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, was asked whether Biden would “continue to extend the privilege” of making classified information available to Trump she replied: “It’s something obviously that’s under review.” Susan Gordon, Trump’s principal executive of national intelligence until 2019, has argued that he should not be briefed on intelligence. “My © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Democrats are too keen to nail Trump for a riot.

It is already too late to make the most of the visceral fear and anger felt by senators during the storming of the Capitol. Yet is it also too soon to bring Trump to book? Several troubling allegations have come to light since the January 6 riot on Capitol Hill and have yet to be properly investigated.

Proud Boys give up support of ‘weak’ Donald Trump,"David Charter, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump’s support among fringe groups that were among his most ardent followers has begun to fracture amid disillusion at his departure from office. Mr Trump was branded a “shill” and “extraordinarily weak” in discussion forums of the Proud Boys, a group of far-right nationalists who often showed up armed to his rallies. Shortly after Joe Biden won the election in November the Proud Boys, posting in a private channel on the messaging app Telegram, urged followers to attend protests against the “stolen” election, writing: “Hail Emperor Trump.” In the same Telegram channel on Monday the Proud Boys said: “Trump will go down as a total failure.” The QAnon conspiracy community is also turning on Mr Trump and the mysterious “Q” figure who started the © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

QAnon had promised its millions of believers that inauguration day would be the Storm; that Donald Trump would somehow forcibly become president for a second term and that all the mysteries of the world would finally be revealed. When Biden was sworn in and the Storm manifestly failed to happen Ron Watkins — who many think is “Q” himself — suddenly posted: “We gave it our all.

The timing is seen as a demonstration to the new US government of China’s resolve to fight any move Washington should take against the country; Beijing is hoping that Mr Biden will return the bilateral ties to their normal tracks. “Over the past few years, some anti-China politicians in the United States, out of their selfish political interests and prejudice and hatred against China and showing no regard for the interests of the Chinese and American people, have planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

"After Daddy, what next for the Trump kids?",The Times,Friday June 11 2021," Kennedy. Bush. Clinton. Trump? America has traditionally loved a political dynasty and never has a president’s departure from the White House been accompanied by such intense speculation about the future of his family as there is now. But the name Trump, while benefiting from universal recognition beyond all rivals’ wildest dreams, also comes freighted with teetering piles of baggage, even when attached to an Ivanka, a Donald Jr or an Eric rather than the Don himself. The president’s political career, of course, may not be over. During the bitter aftermath of his loss to Joe Biden Trump certainly didn’t squash talk that he would return in 2024. The riot at the Capitol and a second impeachment would appear to reduce the likelihood of that happening. © Times Newspapers Limited 2021. Registered in England No. 894646.

The Highland Conservative branch likened the SNP’s demand for more airtime on the BBC to China’s suppression of its Uighur ethnic minority. The branch Facebook page also issued a string of posts condemning the SNP’s “Nationalist Socialist hatred”, which has allusions to the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, which became known as the Nazi party.

Remember George W Bush, who started two wars, lost both and presided over the near-ruin of the global economy? But Trump has managed to alter his historic legacy considerably since election day. On January 2 he made an hour-long phone call to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, in which he intimated it might be “dangerous” and “a big risk” for Georgia officials to deny that Democrats had committed crimes in © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Let us redefine evangelism after the Trump presidency,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," It’s been four years since the dramatic moment when Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election. What a four years it’s been: chaotic, farcical and at times beyond belief. However, even the events of the past few years could not have prepared us for the shocking scenes on Capitol Hill this month. History will speak of these years as a unique season in American politics, when a different kind of president was in power.

But a bust, apparently of Abraham Lincoln, was seen being carried out of the West Wing along with a large stuffed pheasant. Peter Navarro, Mr Trump’s economic adviser, was seen with a framed photograph of Mr Trump facing President Xi of China across a dinner table, apparently taken in Buenos Aires in 2018.

President Trump’s impeachment cannot be erased but Mr Biden could follow the example of Gerald Ford, who saved Richard Nixon from criminal jeopardy to try to draw a line under Watergate in the 1970s. Mr Trump, 74, is considering a final batch of pardons of his own before he stands down on Wednesday, including, perhaps, an attempt to pardon himself.

In 1974 President Ford pardoned Richard Nixon. At the time, along with many others, Bob Woodward derided the move, agreeing with Carl Bernstein’s assessment: “The son of a bitch just pardoned the son of a bitch.” Decades later, Mr Woodward proclaimed the wisdom and courage of Ford’s action. With hindsight, Woodward could see that Ford had been correct; his actions had spared America the consequences of a lengthy impeachment and trial. Ford knew, as a lawyer, that you can’t pardon the innocent; Nixon’s guilt was implicit in his pardon. Could Joe © Times Newspapers Limited 2021. Registered in England No. 894646.

Hunt begins to identify Donald Trump’s rioters,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," There was a moment after the smoke of the US Capitol insurrection had cleared when the chaplain of the Senate stood in prayer with shellshocked legislators and reminded them of the truths that should, to all present, have been glaringly self-evident. “We deplore the desecration of the United States Capitol building, the shedding of innocent blood, the loss of life — and the quagmire of dysfunction that threatened our democracy,” said Chaplain Barry Black as members of Congress bowed their heads. “These tragedies have reminded us that words matter and that the power of life and death is in the tongue.” The rebels carried the flag of a defeated leader, yelling his discredited theories of a stolen election, embracing his cumulative pleas to “fight like © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

America on alert as Donald Trump is impeached for second time,"David Charter, Henry Zeffman, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," President Trump issued an appeal against further violence yesterday as his place in history was sealed when he became the first US leader to be impeached twice. Only 10 out of 211 Republicans joined the vote to impeach Mr Trump for incitement of insurrection in a rushed process that dispensed with witnesses or scrutiny of evidence but was fuelled by raw anger at his role in the storming of the US Capitol last week. Despite the minimal Republican involvement, it was the most bipartisan impeachment in history. In a stunning contrast to January 6, hundreds of armed national guardsmen filled the corridors of Congress as the House of Representatives rushed through a two-hour debate to set up Mr Trump’s second trial in the Senate. © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Donald Trump’s tweets turn focus to social media responsibility after Capitol siege,Jonathan Ames,Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump may have been the first truly social media-savvy US president, but ironically he could have triggered the downfall of those platforms’ business model.

In the US social media networks are protected from liability for their content by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 1996, which states that internet platforms “shall not be treated as the publisher”.

The Democrats in the House were joined by several Republicans who were outraged at Mr Trump’s inflammatory statements.

Liz Cheney puts Speaker hopes on the line to impeach President Trump,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," There is no appreciable short-term political upside in the decision Liz Cheney made to impeach President Trump. Whatever the eventual number of Republicans across both chambers who back the impeachment, they will be a minority. Ms Cheney, a rising star in the party who, as Republican conference chairwoman, is the third most senior in the House, may even lose her leadership role because of her decision. So why do it? Well, perhaps there are two versions of the party’s near-future. In the most likely version, Ms Cheney will become an outcast.

But for the immunity attaching to his office, he would almost certainly have been arrested and charged. Knowing this, Twitter and social media organisations that continued to facilitate such activity would surely themselves be at risk of criminal liability.

Readers’ poll: was Donald Trump to blame for the Capitol riot?,"Sunday January 10 2021, 12.01am, The Sunday Times",Friday June 11 2021," Last week’s attack on the home of the US Congress came after the president urged his supporters to march to the Capitol building. Democrats have blamed Trump for inciting the crowd to violence and called for him to be removed from office and prosecuted. The president’s supporters point out that he sent a tweet explicitly asking his followers to remain peaceful, and say the responsibility lies with the individual perpetrators. What’s your view?

He said she had the power to do so if an applicant’s presence is considered “not conducive to the public good”, arguing that “Trump’s default is to stir up racial tension” and pointing to how he had incited a violent mob.

After years of blithely allowing hatred, misinformation and propaganda to course through their services and spew into the world, the tech giants made a flurry of stunning moves to get rid of some of the most dangerous elements, which, in their estimation, included the president of the United States. The catalysing event, of course, was the attack on the US Capitol building, perpetrated by a mob the president whipped up with unfounded allegations that the election had been “stolen”.

Twitter bans Trump permanently for glorifying violence,"Henry Zeffman, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," President Trump has been banned permanently from Twitter, severing forever his favourite way of communicating with his supporters. The social network explained a move it had resisted for years by saying that Mr Trump’s recent tweets, in which he called his supporters “great American patriots” and declared he would not attend Joe Biden’s inauguration, posed a “risk of further incitement of violence”. The account, which was followed by 89 million people, was at once a source of immense rallying power and a display window for Mr Trump’s most grievous excesses. His unprecedented rise from television stardom to the Oval Office was propelled in no small part by his instinctive grasp of what conservative grassroots craved from the then-nascent platform.

Generals can ignore or delay President Trump’s orders,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," President Trump is commander-in-chief of America’s nuclear forces and military power for 11 more days. Could he start a war before Joe Biden takes over on January 20? He has the power to order a military strike. But, as General James Mattis, Mr Trump’s first defence secretary, showed, orders can be delayed, ignored or modified if judged unwise or dangerous. A former senior US army officer told The Times: “Our oath is to the constitution, not the commander-in-chief.” In other words, unless the US is attacked, there is room for manoeuvre.

As White House staff rushed to denigrate his mental state in the media — the president was described by anonymous officials as “insane”, “beyond the pale” and “mentally unreachable” — it emerged that the threat of legal action helped to persuade Mr Trump to promise a smooth transition of power while also criticising the rioters. On Thursday night Mr Trump, having regained access to his Twitter account, posted a video in which he accepted that there would be a transition on January 20, although he did not mention Joe Biden by name.

Will Donald Trump be impeached and removed from office?,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," It seems increasingly likely.

The first option, using the 25th Amendment to make the vice-president acting president against the president’s will for the first time ever, does not seem to be happening, with a pair of cabinet members and several more lower-ranking officials deciding to take their belated stand through resigning instead.

It also allows for the vice-president to take over the office temporarily if the president is unable to fulfil his or her duties.

Mr McConnell, 78, the Senate majority leader who has so often pushed through the president’s wishes in Congress, warned of “an endless spiral of partisan vengeance” if Mr Trump had his way, just moments before the chamber came under siege. The violence was sparked shortly after the announcement by Mr Pence, in a letter released while © Times Newspapers Limited 2021. Registered in England No. 894646.

The Times view on Trump’s incitement of the assault on the Capitol: Day of Infamy,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," According to the ancient Greeks, no man should be counted happy until the end is known. The same is true of presidencies. Following the extraordinary scenes in Washington on Wednesday night, when supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to disrupt the certification of November’s election results, it is clear that Mr Trump’s term of office will end in dishonour and disgrace. Whatever the accomplishments of his four years as president of the United States, and there were some in both domestic and foreign policy, they count for little beside the damage wrought by his conduct over the past six weeks. His attempt to overturn the result of the election, culminating in the failed insurrection, has further divided his party, shocked © Times Newspapers Limited 2021. Registered in England No. 894646.

US Capitol riots: how armed Trump supporters stormed Congress,"Henry Zeffman, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," James Lankford of Oklahoma was just beginning to explain why he supported overturning the election result when the mob whose challenge he was backing made it too dangerous for his speech to continue. “My challenge today is not about the good people of Arizona . . .” and then the gavel came down. “Protesters are in the building,” a masked aide whispered in his ear. “Thank you,” a startled Mr Lankford replied. Mike Pence, the vice-president, was spirited away from the Senate dias by the Secret Service, needing to be protected from supporters of the president he has served for four years.

"End this siege, Biden urges Trump","Wednesday January 06 2021, 9.00pm, The Times",Friday June 11 2021," Joe Biden, the president elect, has urged Trump supporters rioting on Capitol Hill to “pull back and allow democracy to go forward”. “At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times,” Mr Biden said, adding that what unfolded was, “an assault on the rule of law like few times we have ever seen it.” He said the uprising bordered on sedition, adding: “The scenes of chaos at the capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are.” “I call on this mob to pull back and allow democracy to go forward.

Christian Lindberg: 2017 review — a horrified response to Donald Trump’s arrival as president,Geoff Brown,Friday June 11 2021," Christian Lindberg

★★★★☆ Solace may be needed after this turbulent week in American politics, but you won’t find much in the main attraction of the new album composed and conducted by Sweden’s star trombone player Christian Lindberg, always an irrepressible force. The piece is called 2017, written throughout that ominous year as a horrified response to Donald Trump’s arrival as America’s 45th president. Probably it’s the first musical work to be dedicated to an American TV commentator, the incisive Rachel Maddow. Portentous chords and agitated judderings from the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra immediately tell us that Lindberg is not putting out the welcome mat.

Donald Trump piles pressure on Mike Pence to reverse his election defeat to Joe Biden,"David Charter and Henry Zeffman, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," President Trump is exerting maximum pressure on Mike Pence, the vice president, to overturn his election defeat as Congress meets today to ratify the result in a test of the constitution and rule of law in America. A large crowd of Trump supporters is expected to take to Washington’s streets as votes from two Senate elections yesterday to decide control of the upper chamber are counted in Georgia. Joe Biden is due to be sworn in on January 20 after winning the presidential election in November but Mr Trump has refused to concede. He told supporters in Georgia that he still had plans to contest the outcome based on as-yet unproven claims of fraud.

US Senate election: Georgia’s voters stream to polls as Trump vows to ‘fight like hell’,"Henry Zeffman, David Charter, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," Georgia’s voters are streaming to the polls in two critical senate races the day after President Trump told supporters at a rally in the state that he would “fight like hell” to remain in the White House. The twin runoffs will decide the balance of the Senate, and as a result play a major role in determining what actions Joe Biden can take as president when he is sworn in in a fortnight’s time.

FBI faces demands to investigate Donald Trump’s call to turn election,"David Charter, Washington",Friday June 11 2021," The Republican party is increasingly split over President Trump’s efforts to overturn the election result by pressuring officials in Georgia to “find” votes and pushing for Congress to revolt against Joe Biden’s victory. As Democrats called on the FBI to investigate Mr Trump’s leaked phone call to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, Liz Cheney, a senior Republican in the House of Representatives, described it as “deeply troubling”. Mr Trump, 74, meanwhile, railed at Republican senators who are refusing to join a dozen colleagues in objecting to election results in swing stages during a joint session of Congress tomorrow. The president has made unproven claims of fraud. He was particularly angered when Tom Cotton, an Arkansas senator who has been loyal to him, announced © Times Newspapers Limited 2021.

Phone call that could land Donald Trump in legal trouble,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," President Trump has been accused of crossing ethical, moral and potentially legal boundaries in his phone call urging the secretary of state in Georgia to revise the election results to make him the winner rather than Joe Biden. David Charter examines the most controversial excerpts and their possible consequences “So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.” Mr Trump’s exhortation to “find” the exact number of votes required to reverse the election outcome is seen as potentially the most damaging remark.

Big tech not Trump is subverting democracy,The Times,Friday June 11 2021," Among those who wrongly assumed that a British judge would rubber-stamp America’s request for the extradition of the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was the left-wing American commentator Glenn Greenwald. Disapprovingly, however, he noted that the American case had been rejected on humanitarian grounds alone and that the judge believed that there were still grounds to prosecute Assange for the disclosure of official secrets. Greenwald was a key reporter on the 2013 Guardian articles that published Edward Snowden’s leaks from National Security Agency surveillance programmes. He has also backed Chelsea Manning, the former US army intelligence analyst who leaked classified documents to Assange.

In a startling hour-long telephone conversation on Saturday Mr Trump cajoled and threatened Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state of Georgia, insisting that he had been cheated of victory on November 3 by a “criminal” conspiracy. “There’s nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you’ve recalculated,” Mr Trump said, according to a recording of the call published by The Washington Post. “So look,” he added. “All I want to do is this.

Another bad year for Turnberry takes Trump’s loss to nearly £46m,Stuart MacDonald,Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort posted a loss of more than £2.3 million in 2019, according to its accounts.

President Trump and Joe Biden to campaign in Georgia in final push for crucial senate vote,Ben Hoyle,Friday June 11 2021," President Trump and Joe Biden will both campaign in Georgia today at the climax of the most expensive Senate battle in American history. Two Republican incumbents are pitted against two Democratic challengers in a pair of runoff elections that will determine which party controls the US Senate for the next two years. Polling suggests that the races between David Perdue and Jon Ossoff and between Kelly Loeffler and the Rev Raphael Warnock are both too close to call heading into polling day tomorrow and a split outcome, enough for the Republicans to keep their majority in the Senate, remains a firm possibility.

Republicans weigh their options: join Donald Trump’s ‘coup’ or risk his vengeance?,"Sarah Baxter, Atlanta",Friday June 11 2021," Donald Trump is marshalling his forces for one last effort to salvage his lame-duck presidency after demanding that Congress refuse to certify Joe Biden’s election victory. His attempt to mount a constitutional coup is certain to go down in flames this week, but he has succeeded in persuading a large number of Republican lawmakers to join his cause. Trump has called for a huge “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington as a show of strength against members of Congress who believe it is their duty to confirm Biden’s win.
