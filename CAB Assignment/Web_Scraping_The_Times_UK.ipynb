With characteristic showmanship the former Apprentice host unveiled Neil Gorsuch as his chosen nominee on prime time television, having first ramped up the suspense by summoning both leading candidates for the lifetime appointment to the capital. Moments after he revealed Judge Gorsuch, 49, as his pick, Mr Trump stretched his arms out before a White House audience that included senior political figures, members of the president’s family and the widow of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose death created the vacancy. “So, was that a surprise? Was it?” Mr Trump demanded. © Times Newspapers Limited 2021. Registered in England No. 894646. Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, SE1 9GF.'}"
